<h1>
  <u>Little Leo on the go!🐈‍🐈‍</u></h1>
<p>
  Little Leo is on the <strong>run!</strong> <br>
  Little leo just wants to have <em>fun</em><br>
  Little leo can sleep all day🌞<br>
  But during the <strong>darkest</strong> nights, he's ready to play🌝<br>
  Little Leo loves to <em>munch</em><br>
  And Little Leo likes <em>cuddles</em> so much<br>
  I love Little Leo <font size="1">down</font>  to his whiskers<br>
  His meows have started to drown the whispers.
</p>
<h2> Little Leo Active!</h2>
